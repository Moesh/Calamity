# Players shouldn't be able to place blocks over the void. To stop this, we use moving_piston blocks
#   which normally are used for marking blocks which are being pushed. Here are some of the
#   benefits:
#       • Players cannot place blocks on moving_piston blocks
#       • The block can not be pushed
#       • Water can't flow through them
#       • The block has no hitbox (cannot be targetted)
#       • Arrows can fly through them

# The only problem with the block is that TNT can blow it up. To fix this, we have to find all TNT
#   which are about to explode and fix the destroyed walls of moving_piston blocks.

# Extra notes about moving_piston:
#   Normally the block has tile entity data to store information about the pushed block, but when
#   setblocked it won't. This is lucky for us since tile entities in big amounts can be laggy. So we
#   shouldn't get any perfomance issues from having a ton of these blocks.moving_piston doesn't drop
#   any items when it doesn't have tile entity data. If it did drop items then we could just execute
#   at those items and place new blocks to fix the explosion damage.moving_piston blocks doesn't
#   have any blast resistance so it shouldn't mess with the TNT explosions.


# We can't detect the TNT after it has exploded.
# We summon a marker entity at TNT which is about to explode so we can use its location after
#   it has blown up.
execute as @e[tag=ExplosionMarker] at @s run function calamity:build_protection/handle_explosion
execute as @e[type=tnt,nbt={Fuse: 1s}] at @s run summon minecraft:area_effect_cloud ~ ~ ~ {Duration: 2, Tags: ["ExplosionMarker"]}

# Also have to fix the protection if it was blown up by a bed. There is no real way to detect a bed
#   explosion, so we have changed the bed loot tables to drop a nether star when they are broken.
#   Now we can execute from the star and fix the protection. We're using nether stars because they
#   cannot be blown up.
