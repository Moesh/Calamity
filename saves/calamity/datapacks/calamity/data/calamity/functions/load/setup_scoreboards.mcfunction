# Called from: #calamity:load
# TODO: Remove this from map loading state on release.

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose: When a objective is removed, all of its data is wiped clean. Since we use the scoreboard
#	primarily for storing data, this becomes an efficient way to hard reset the project to its
#	"factory state". If this projet were to ever need some kind of persistent data between sessions,
#	another solution should be designed.
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Remove Scoreboard Objectives
# CONSTANT scoreboard stores values which should not be changed or altered in any way. They are
